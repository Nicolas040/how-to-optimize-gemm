Copy the contents of file [`MMult_4x4_14.c`](../blob/master/src/MMult_4x4_14.c) into a file named [`MMult_4x4_15.c`](../blob/master/src/MMult_4x4_15.c) and change the contents.

 * Change the first lines in the `makefile` to
```makefile
OLD  := MMult_4x4_14
NEW  := MMult_4x4_15
```
 * `make run`
```matlab
octave:3> PlotAll        % this will create the plot
```

This time the performance graph will look something like

And, again, we add some code that makes it so that we avoid repacking the kx4 blocks of B.  Performance is now impressive!
