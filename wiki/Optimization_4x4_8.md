Copy the contents of file [`MMult_4x4_7.c`](../blob/master/src/MMult_4x4_7.c) into a file named [`MMult_4x4_8.c`](../blob/master/src/MMult_4x4_8.c) and change the contents:


Change the first lines in the `makefile` to
```makefile
OLD  := MMult_4x4_7
NEW  := MMult_4x4_8
```
 * `make run`
```matlab 
octave:3> PlotAll        % this will create the plot
```

This time the performance graph will look something like

We now use registers to store the elements of the current row of B.  (Notice that we did not do this for the case where we computed C four elements at a time.)  The performance actually drops slightly.  But this step enables further optimizations.
