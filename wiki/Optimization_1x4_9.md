Copy the contents of file [`MMult_1x4_8.c`](../blob/master/src/MMult_1x4_8.c) into a file named [`MMult_1x4_9.c`](../blob/master/src/MMult_1x4_9.c) and change the contents.

Change the first lines in the `makefile` to
```makefile
OLD  := MMult_1x4_8
NEW  := MMult_1x4_9     
```
 * `make run`
```matlab
octave:3> PlotAll        % this will create the plot
```

This time the performance graph will look something like

We now use something called 'indirect addressing'.   Notice, for example, the line 
```c
    c_00_reg += a_0p_reg * *(bp0_pntr+1);
```
Here 

 *`a0p_reg` holds the element `A( 0, p+1 )`  (yes, this is a bit confusing.  A better name for the variable would be good...)

 * We want to `bp0_pntr` points to element `B( p, 0 )`.  Hence `bp0_pntr+1` addresses the element `B( p+1, 0 )`.  There is a special machine instruction to then access the element at `bp0_pntr+1` that does not require the pointer to be updated.

 * As a result, the pointers that address the elements in the columns of B only need to be updated once every fourth iteration of the loop.

Interestingly, it appears that the compiler did this optimization automatically, and hence we see no performance improvement...
