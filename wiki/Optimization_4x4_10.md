Copy the contents of file [`MMult_4x4_9.c`](../blob/master/src/MMult_4x4_9.c)  into a file named [`MMult_4x4_10.c`](../blob/master/src/MMult_4x4_10.c) and change the contents:


Change the first lines in the `makefile` to
```makefile
OLD  := MMult_4x4_9
NEW  := MMult_4x4_10
```
 * `make run`
```matlab
octave:3> PlotAll        % this will create the plot
```

This time the performance graph will look something like

Finally, we use the vector registers and vector operations.
